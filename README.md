# RtoAuthorea

[Authorea](https://www.authorea.com)Â is a collaborative writing platform for researchers and has some nice features such as:

- Authorea can easily be linked with an existing GitHub account.
- Authorea's instant search to locate a reference by author, keyword, or DOI makes it very easy to add references.
- Authorea understands (rich) text, markdown, html and latex
- Text, markdown, html and latex can be mixed in the same manuscript.

It seems that Authorea has the potential to at least partly solve the [Workflow for publications using Rmarkdown with users that won't get passed Word/Google docs](https://github.com/ropensci/unconf18/issues/42) issue.

I decided to try it out. This repository is linked to [this Authorea document](https://www.authorea.com/324602/-lakW_gmm7oe7zmyt-0NhA) and it documents my first experience with Authorea and how it can be linked to R. **This is work in progress**.
