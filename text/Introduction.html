<h1 data-label="632410" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>Recently we submitted our first manuscript that was entirely written in Rmarkdown&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep[see][]{Roth_2018}</cite>. The code to produce the manuscript can be downloaded from&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/TobiasRoth/NDep-Trend" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> . Rmarkdown is a great way to provide reproducible data analyses and in connection with the version control provided by git / GitHub it is also a great environment to develop the analyses from the first ideas to the final figures and tables. However, we felt that the system wasnot yet well adapted to a smooth writing process, which includes the writing of the first draft but also collaboratively developing the final MS among the authors (we were eight).&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div>R, Rmarkdown and Github are great (amazing), but:</div><ul><li>Workflow for publications using Rmarkdown with users that won't get passed word (see&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ropensci/unconf18/issues/42" target="_blank">this thread</a>)</li><li>When writing text you end up changing a lot between the formatted version of the manuscript (pdf, html) to read and the rmarkdown files to make corrections.&nbsp;</li><li>Handling the references in rmarkdown-files is a bit time-consuming especially if you have a lot of them.</li></ul><div>My wishlist to add to the rmarkdown --&gt; github workflo would be the following</div><ul><li></li></ul><div></div><div>Interesting features of AUTHOREA:</div><ul><li>It can easily be linked with own GitHub account</li><li>Splits text into blocks --&gt; It is easier to customize from R</li><li>it understands markdown, rich text and latex --&gt; That is great.</li></ul><div></div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="543922" class="ltx_title_section">Setting-up</h1><h2 data-label="449235" class="ltx_title_subsection">New repository from scratch</h2><ul><li>Add new document to AUTHOREA and just write the name you of the repository as the title of the document.
