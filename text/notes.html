This was because I added a figure within an existing text bloc  using the Authorea interface . Authorea then needs to splits the text bloc into two and adds a new&nbsp; html file to the repository that contains the second part of the original text bloc.&nbsp;In the background, Authorea of course integrates the new html file also into<code>layout.md</code> to make sure that the new text bloc is included into the document. I wasn't aware of that and changed&nbsp;<code>layout.rm</code> from R at the same time, which obviously led to a merging conflict. In case of a merging conflict Authorea  pushes to a separate branch (by default this branch is labeled as&nbsp;<i>authorea</i>, but you can change it in the deploy key settings). To fix the problem I created a new pull request from my GitHub repository and merged the&nbsp;<i>authorea&nbsp;</i>branch back into the master branch. This worked well and everything seemed to be fine again. However, I then started to change the figure from R as described above. The new figure turned up in the&nbsp;<code>Data</code> folder&nbsp; of the Authorea document as expected but it did not change in the document itself.&nbsp; I suspected that this was an issue related to the cache of the browser, but simply reloading the html-page did not help. Furthermore, I soon ran into the next merging conflict that I did not really understood. I was not able to really understand the issue and to definitively solve it using  pull request. Thus I decided to completely delete the document on Authorea and connected theGitHub repository to a new and empty Authorea document as explained above. I just opened the&nbsp;<code>layout.md</code> file from Authorea (from the&nbsp;<code>Data</code> folder )&nbsp; and pasted the content from the old&nbsp;<code>layout.md</code>&nbsp;file. After having done so the document reappeared as it used to be and everything worked fine again (including changing the figure from R). I think the short question is: <i>How to properly solve a merging conflict?</i></div><div></div><h2 data-label="710008" class="ltx_title_subsection">Why Authorea stores a copy of a figure?</h2><div>When adding a figure using the Authorea interface, Authorea seems to save the figure two times (one is labeled as the original). What is the use of it? This question is emerging when I aim to change a figure from R. Which figure do I need to change? I suspect that either figure could be used depending on how the document is viewed / exported (html vs. pdf vs. docx)? Is there a figure format that should be preferred? I personally would prefer to use .pdf or .png?</div><div></div><div></div><ul><li>Sometimes it seems necessary to manually pull from or push to GitHub. This is rather easy just ad&nbsp;<code>/git_functions</code> at the end of the url.&nbsp;</li></ul><div></div><h1 data-label="808908" class="ltx_title_section">Discussion</h1><div>In this document we  document our first experience with using Authorea in connection with R and GitHub. We aimed to better understand the behavior of Authorea and asked whether it could make sense to include Authorea into the workflow of conducting a data analyses project that should be finally published in a scientific manuscript.&nbsp; In short, we are very positive that integrating Authorea into our current workflow with R and GitHub could help to considerably improve  the writing part of a scientific projects and improve the reprod. So this document can be considered as a proof of concept. Ob</div><div></div><h2 data-label="501257" class="ltx_title_subsection">How to improve things</h2><div>The&nbsp;</div>
