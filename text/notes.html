This was because I added a figure within an existing text bloc  using the Authorea interface . Authorea then needs to splits the text bloc into two and adds a new&nbsp; html file to the repository that contains the second part of the original text bloc.&nbsp;In the background, Authorea of course integrates the new html file also into<code>layout.md</code> to make sure&nbsp; I wasn't aware of that and changed&nbsp;<code>layout.rm</code> from R at the same time, which led to a merging conflict. In case of a merging conflict Authorea  pushes to a separate branch (by default this branch is labeled as&nbsp;<i>authorea</i>, but you can change it in the deploy key settings).
