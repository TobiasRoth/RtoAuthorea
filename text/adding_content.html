Then we add an R file that produces the latex code of the table and write it into the&nbsp;<i>.tex&nbsp;</i>-File<i>.&nbsp;</i>The R-code to produce Table&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{tab:}</span><i>&nbsp;</i>can be inspected&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/TobiasRoth/RtoAuthorea/blob/master/tables/latex_table/latex_table.R" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp; When clicking on the table itself the latex code that was produced by the R script is shown. When collaborates change this latex code (e..g to change the caption) you need to make sure to manually include the changes  into the R script that is producing the table. This can easily be done with the&nbsp;<code>diff</code>&nbsp;comparison that is implemented in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rstudio.com" target="_blank">RStudio</a>:&nbsp; when you run the R-script to produce the Latex code for the table just hit the&nbsp;<code>diff</code> button in the&nbsp;<code>git</code> tab. The differences between the old version and new version of the .tex file will be shown and you may see some changes that&nbsp;</div>
